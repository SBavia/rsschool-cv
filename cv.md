## About Me
My goal is to create a portfolio of 3-4 projects by the end of the year, and if I'm lucky, I'll already work as a front-end developer. I work well in a team, quickly grasp information, constantly learning something new. I worked as a system administrator, after which I decided to develop in the direction of programming.

## Skills
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (Basic)
* Git

## Code example
```
const sayHi = name => {
  const message = 'How are you?';
  
  console.log(`Hi ${name}. ${message}`);
};
```
